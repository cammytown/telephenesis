# Telephenesis
Telephenesis (https://telephenesis.com) is a visualization of the metamorphosis of a musical idea as it is reinterpreted and recreated by different artists. It's like the game "Telephone", but with music.

First, someone composes a piece of music and uploads it in digital form to the website. It shows up as a star in an outerspace interface. When a user clicks the star, the track plays.

Then, other artists can come along and remix or recreate a star's music. They upload their version and it, too, is represented as a star; this time with a line to its origin.

Listeners and browse through a growing constellation of the progression of musical ideas as they are relayed from one mind to another.
