## TODO
### 3
- progress bar along bottom
	| also in header probably

- refactor code
	- clean up how we pass star data around; very sloppy atm

- organize/filter the universe by newness, popularity, etc.
- figure out how to sustain hosting costs
	- maybe only subscribers can upload and if you cancel then at some point your track may be moved to archive.org hosting
		- alternatively, we just monthly make a big archive.org post with the tracks if they don't mind

### 2

### 1
- change theme of interface to color of playing star (didn't we already start something like this?)
	| make color lockable

### 0
- get webpack config to handle SASS?
- rename instances of "sid" to "starID", probably
