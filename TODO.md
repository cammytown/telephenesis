## TODO

- improve appearance of audio player
	| are images part of the player or do you view them separately?

- create a shifting color theme which effects all elements
	| allow for user to select consistent color(s)

- make aud submodule
- move js files and libs into js/libs folder

- fix help and profile links
- hitting escape or clicking in space should close the menu

- reimplement admin features
- visual stars are squares, music are circles?
- sort stars

- add numbers/tier level to stars
- make first stars appear slightly different

- progress bar along bottom
	| also in header probably

- refactor code
	- clean up how we pass star data around; very sloppy atm

- organize/filter the universe by newness, popularity, etc.
- figure out how to sustain hosting costs
	- maybe only subscribers can upload and if you cancel then at some point your track may be moved to archive.org hosting
		- alternatively, we just monthly make a big archive.org post with the tracks if they don't mind
